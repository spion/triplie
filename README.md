# INTRODUCTION


Triplie is an AI bot based on 2nd up to 6th order Markov model. It uses an SQLite database for storage, and can be distributed to work on multiple machines on a LAN.

Triplie creates directed graphs which are made of

1. nodes, which represent the words read from the user
2. A graph representing Markov chains of 6th order
3. links that represent the associations between words from conversations in a network based on the Hebbian rule

To respond to a user, triplie extracts keywords from the user's text, finds their most appropriate associated keywords in the Hebbian association network, and generates replies that contain the associated keywords using multiple breadth-first-search Markov chains algorithm.

For more information on installing and configuring read below or see the README wiki page.

You can join the project's IRC channel too: #triplie on irc.freenode.net


# COMPILE

Prerequisites

	sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev libboost-regex-dev
	apt-cyg install libsqlite3-devel libboost-devel

To compile, unpack and type

    make

The generated binaries will be called `triplie` and `cmdtriplie`
`triplie` is the IRC version and `cmdtriplie` is the command line version.
An additional binary `worktriplie` is also generated, which can be used
for distributed processing (presently undocumented and unsupported)

If you want to feed the bot with existing text data, you're also going to 
need feedtriplie. To build it, type.

    make feedtriplie

Configure the bot as explained below before running!


# CONFIGURATION

If running the bot for the first time (there is no database file)
you should type

    make bootstrap

to create the initial database file in botdata/triplie.db

### Edit triplie.conf

First thing to edit is triplie.conf. Here is what it must contain unless specified by argument:

    server irc.freenode.net 6667
    nick triplie
    ident triplie
    name Triplie Diplie
    chan #triplie #otherchan
	
here is what it in addition can contain
	
	db file.db	
	pass
    sleep min max
	partake 1 2
	speak 120 240
    char !
    use_default_response false

• server. The line specifies the server here. This line MUST contain 3 words:
server hostname portnumber
They must all be correct. Otherwise the bot will not connect to the
server.

• nick. The line is in the format "nick yourbotsnick" If the nickname is in
use, this simple version will not try another nick. Also, the nickname
must be lowercase, letters/numbers only.

• ident. The line is what will appear as the username of the bot if no identd
is installed on the machine. Same rules as for nick apply.

• name. Specifies the real name of the bot.

• chan. The line specifies the default channels. When run, triplie will ALWAYS
try to join these channels first. The channel names are separated with space.

• db. Database file.

• pass. Server password. 

• sleep. Specifies minimum/maximum pause time between request and answer,
in seconds. For example `sleep 2 7` will make the bot wait between 2 and 7 seconds before answering. This is
used to prevent people from flooding the bot.

• partake. Control unsolicited reply (reply to channel message even when bot nickname is not in the message). The first argument is the reply probability given as 0 to 100. 0 is no replies. The second argument is the highest amount of total channel messages during the past minute that allow an unsolicited reply. 0 is no limit.

• speak. Control unsolicited speak (speak on own initiative). The arguments are the minimum and maximum seconds without channel messages that will trigger speak.

• char. Specifies the command char prefix. 

• use_default_response. Toggles default english response when the AI is unable to find an appropriate one. 
Default is true

Note that these lines can be handled in any order, but it is important that
there are no missing parameters in any of them. Also, all the starting words
of those lines MUST be lowercase!

### Edit admins.dat / ignores.dat

admins.dat is a simple file which lists all nick!user@hosts with admin access.
Admins can join or part the bot, get stats for the database, use op/deop/voice
and devoice commands, change a channel topic using the bot, etc.
Choose your admin hosts carefully. On Undernet I recommend using 

    *!*@youruser.users.undernet.org 
    
for better security. On freenode the unaffiliated/affiliated hostmasks are a
good choice. At the end it should look something like this:

    mynick*!*myident@myvhost.myisp.com
    *!*@myxuser.users.undernet.org
    *!*@unaffiliated/adminnickname

You can have as many lines as you want in this file, and every line should
be a hostmask like the 2 above. You can also have only 1 line.

Obviously, ignores.dat lists ignore hosts. They are in the same format.
Its recommended that triplie ignores other triplies

### Create triplie.db

This is not a configuration file. Its best left intact.

However you should check if this file is present in the botdata
directory before running the bot for the first time. If its not, type

    make bootstrap

to create it.

It contains all the data that the bot has learned so far.

# IMPORT EXISTING TEXT

You can import several types of text with the provided scripts:

    ./feed_xchat.sh path/to/logfile [database.db]

allows you to feed an xchat-style logfile to the bot.

For plain text files you can use

prerequisites

	if [ $(uname -o) == 'Cygwin' ]; then s=; else s=sudo; fi; f=stanford-parser-2012-07-09.tgz; $s mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/java; wget -N http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/$f; 7z e $f -so|$s 7z e -aoa -si -ttar -o/usr/local/lib/java */stanford-parser.jar; rm "$f"

    ./feed_text.sh path/to/textfile.txt [database.db]

### Advanced import

The `feedtriplie` binary supports a regular expression which 
should extract the following groups, in order:

  - *message_time* - either a unix timestamp in seconds, or `Y M D h m s`
    separated with either of the following: `:- TZ`. You can be
    less specific e.g. only have h m s or m:s (or just h:m but
    that one might not work as expected)
  - *location* - where was the message sent? e.g. a channel 
    (optional, can be omited)
  - *person* - who sent the message?
  - *message* - text of the message.

See `feed_xchat.sh` and `feed_text.sh` for examples

# COMMANDS

List of triplie's commands:

1) !join #channel
- makes the bot join the specified channel. At the present moment,
the bot does not remember the channel after shutdown.

2) !part #channel

3) !quit quitmsg
- the bot will quit IRC.

3.1) !die quitmsg
- the bot qill quit IRC and the triplie process will end.

4) !op nick1 nick2 ... nick6
- ops specified nicknames in the current channel. The other commands
!deop !vo !devo work similar to !op but are for deop, voice and devoice.

5) !topic some topic
- changes the topic of the current channel. Note that some characters are
removed and the topic is converted to lowercase

6.1) !db stats
- triplie will output database statistics

!cmd set the option silently. !!cmd confirm the command to the sending channel or user.

# NOTES

triplie has been tested on ubuntu linux, gentoo linux, FreeBSD and Cygwin. 
Please let me know if your unix-like system is unable to compile the bot.

This is an beta release, it could contain bugs and have unoptimised
resource usage. I'm hoping to improve that in next versions
